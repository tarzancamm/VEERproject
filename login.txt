Stuff I need
- persist a user's session when they login or signup
- if a user is already logged in and authenticated, we will create a token in local storage. For simplicity, this will just be the user's email (not secure)
- when a user logs out, the local storage needs to be cleared of any token
- when a user logs in/registers, that local storage needs to be created
- when the page is loaded, we need to check if there is local storage with a user's login already. If it exists with a valid account, then go to home page of app and skip signin page
- any backend requests that require a user to be logged in when made, need to send the token with them and have it verified that it is an actual account with every associated controller function

3 ways to store
- local storage
- cookies
- cache
