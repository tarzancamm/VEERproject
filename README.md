Mainstream tourist attractions are overrated. VEER is a full-stack web app that helps you find unique and cultural adventures to do on your next trip abroad.

Users can find random adventures by clicking on the country of their choice. A modal window displays the name of the adventure, cost and any pertinent information needed to find or do the adventure. Anyone can add an adventure to VEER - just click Add My Adventure in the upper righthand corner and fill out the Add An Adventure form. A postgreSQL database houses the adventures, and returns a random adventure each time a user clicks on a country on the homepage.
